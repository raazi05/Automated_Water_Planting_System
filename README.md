Water Automation System 💧🌱

This project is an Arduino-powered water automation system designed to monitor soil moisture and automatically water plants when needed. Built using Java and Firmata4J, it reads real-time moisture levels, displays data on an OLED screen, and activates a water pump when the soil is too dry. Ideal for small-scale smart gardening or IoT experimentation.

Features
🌡 Moisture Sensing – Monitors soil voltage levels to detect dryness

🚰 Automatic Watering – Activates a pump when the soil needs hydration

📟 OLED Display – Shows live moisture voltage and pump status

⏱ Event-Based Logic – Uses asynchronous programming to react to sensor input in real-time

💻 Java Integration – Control and monitor the system using a Java GUI or console

Tech Stack
Java (Firmata4J, SLF4J)

Arduino (Soil moisture sensor, relay module, water pump, OLED screen)
